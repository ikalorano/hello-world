# hello-world
This is my first repository on github. More to follow soon!
I have been open to learning programming right from when i knew what programming is
Although, never could pursue it like I wanted because of school exams, IITJEE competitive exams
Now I am in First Year of UG Engg Course in CSE. Its the perfect time for me to learn and grow.
I am here on GitHub with the same purpose, will fulfil it in some more time just when it's the right time.
